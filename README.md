# IoT Project: People Counting and Tracking with mmWave Radar
This repo contains project codes for analyzing mmWave signal data to perform people counting and localization.

This is a group project and my main contribution includes researching related signal analysis method and applying & tuning the method on the collected data.

## Download sensing data
```
# pip install gdown
gdown 1DQ_7lj_4_qrwbp1cBtmYehDYm7wUr9W-
```

## Run analysis and evaluate result
**analysis.ipynb**: jupyter notebook for perform people counting and localization on signal data

**evaluation.ipynb**: jupyter notebook for evaluating the accuracy of our methods on the 2 tasks
